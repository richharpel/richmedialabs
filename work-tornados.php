				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>The Tornados Running Club was founded in Houston, TX over 20 years ago by Miguel Lopez to promote the sport of running and fitness.<p>
				
				<p>While in Houston I joined the Tornados and it was soon found out that I could help with the club website. Well I also offered my services with a new logo as the original was a hand drawing of a half man half tornado. The club loved my logo concepts but ultimately decided to stick with tradition and keep the original logo.</p>
