					<p class="lead">I take pride in providing personal attention and a single point of contact on all projects no matter the size. Keeping things small has allowed me to remain personally connected with both my clients and the work I do for them.</p>
										
					<p class="lead">With a solid background in graphic design and web development, I'm able to bring a creative eye to interactive projects that most developers can't match. My design experience includes a BFA in Graphic Design from Louisiana State University as well as 18+ years at various agencies, web companies and start-ups. Over those years I have completed projects for many recognizable clients including: <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, <a href="http://www.hershey.com" target="_blank">Hershey's</a>, <a href="http://www.hyatt.com" target="_blank">Hyatt Hotels</a>, <a href="http://www.fritolay.com" target="_blank">Frito Lay</a>, <a href="http://www.marykay.com" target="_blank">Mary Kay</a>, <a href="http://www.nfl.com" target="_blank">NFL</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="http://www.ucrrealty.com" target="_blank">UCR</a>, <a href="http://www.srsre.com" target="_blank">SRS Realty</a> and <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com" target="_blank">Sony Pictures</a></p>

						      	<h3>Discovery</h3>
								<p>During the this stage, I spend time getting to know you and your business or organization. I may ask you to provide copies of your current marketing materials and most likely I will be asking a lot of questions. I also assess your overall business strategy, marketing objectives, target audience, competition, project and design preferences, ideas, and more.</p>

						      	<h3>Proposal</h3>
								<p>After I have gathered the information, goals, and objectives needed for the project, I generate a proposal to address your requirements. My proposal includes an overall project description, the project timeline, a list of deliverables and an estimate of the total project cost.  If youâ€™re happy with it, we commit to working together.</p>

						  	<div class="span10">
						      	<h3>Create</h3>
								<p>Once the proposal is accepted, I begin to conceptualize the design and to develop the overall structure for the project. During this stage, I may submit to you for your feedback &amp; approval: Wire-Frames, Design Concepts and Mock-up(s). We will ensure that the overall design suits the functionality required for the project.</p>

						  	<div class="span10">
						      	<h3>Development</h3>
								<p>After your approval of the design concept and overall project structure, I begin to build your website. The production phase is often the longest phase of the project. I build out all pages and propagate with content and graphics, I code and develop all technical requirements (database, contact forms, drop down menus, content management integration, etc). Once the site has been built it will be tested to ensure cross-browser compatibility. We then turn it over to you to review. Revisions, if needed, are made to the project based on the feedback.</p>

						  	<div class="span10">
						      	<h3>Deploy</h3>
								<p>Once we receive your final approval, your site is ready to "go live"! Depending on the type of project, I may: upload your web files to your live web server &amp; submit the site to search engines (web projects) or submit to you the final files in printer ready format (print projects).</p>
