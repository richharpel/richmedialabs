				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>United Commercial Realty is a recognized market leader in retail real estate services. They know how to consistently create extraordinary results for retailers, developers, investors and owners. At the heart of their business is developing enduring, trusting relationships with clients.</p>
				
				<p>The UCR Realty website was designed with photography in mind. The client wanted an open clean layout that could display their retail offerings through photography. The square shape pulled from the existing logo was mimicked through out the site and helped in defining the strong grid based layout. Along with the front end development this project called for an extensive custom CMS that would allow for maintenance of the website as well as an large property list. A flash based property search application was tied into the CMS to allow users to search by type, location, keyword or visual map.</p>
