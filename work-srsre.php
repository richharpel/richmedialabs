				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>In 1986, Roger Staubach and Chris Maguire created Staubach Retail Services. In 2009, they evolved into SRS Real Estate Partners. Today, SRS is proudly the largest real estate firm exclusively dedicated to retail services in the U.S. Headquartered in Dallas with more than 20 offices worldwide, they help their clients outsmart the competition.</p>
				
				<p>The design work for the SRS website was done in house and delivered to me for development. This project included an extensive custom CMS to allow SRS to not only manage the site's content, but also the ability to maintain it's National listing of retail properties as well as 100s of team members. Another highlight of the CMS is it's ability to take property data and dynamically build working HTML Email and PDF templates for distribution to potential clients. A flash based property search application was tied into the CMS to allow users to search by type, location, keyword and view the property on a Google based map.</p>
