				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>Spaeth Communications, Inc. is a Dallas-based firm recognized as a leader in the communications field for its innovative training and strategic consulting. Founded in 1987 by Merrie Spaeth, the company has handled internal and external communication for local, national and international corporations and organizations during financial restructurings, downsizings, labor negotiations, litigation and commercial disputes, factory and hospital closings, acquisitions, mergers, product tamperings, industrial accidents, bankruptcies, and key personnel changes.</p>
				
				<p>The original Spaeth website was packed with good information but needed some organization and a cleaner design to make it easier to get to. By floating the site on a white background and sticking to grays and red through out the site I was able to achieve a clean business feel. Much of the site's content needed to be updated regularly, so I developed a custom CMS for Spaeth that allows them to add, modify and delete content internally.</p>
