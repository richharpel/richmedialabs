				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>comMotion Interactive was a start-up dot com company (com Motion) that I was with in the mid 90s. We began as primarily a web company and quickly found a niche in online gaming with the "advergaming" popularity of that time.</p>
				
				<p>This project was a rebranding of the web company into a more exciting interactive and gaming company. The initial project called for a company name. The name comMotion served 2 parts, it included com (as in .com) and it also positioned the company as a whirl wind of interactive progress. With the name decided on, we needed a logo with some "motion" and what's more powerful than a tornado. The edgy branding carried over to our print pieces with the use of rounded corners and metallic ink.</p>
